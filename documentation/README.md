# Documentation Index

This folder is the source of truth for project documentation.

## Start Here

- `SETUP.md` - canonical contributor setup path
- `QUICK_START.md` - shortest path to run and use the app
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - environment variables and examples
- `COMMAND_REFERENCE.md` - root script and workflow command map
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - symptom-driven troubleshooting matrix

## Feature / Domain Docs

- `BACKEND.md` - backend-focused development notes
- `FRONTEND.md` - frontend-focused development notes
- `FSRS_OPTIMIZER.md` - FSRS optimizer integration details
- `WEBAPP_SCENARIOS.md` - user UX journeys mapped to API calls (implemented + theorized)

## Internal / Private Notes

Non-production planning docs (roadmaps, analysis, internal plans) are stored in:

- `private/README.md`

## Convention

- Keep production-facing docs in `documentation/`.
- Keep non-production/internal docs in `private/`.
- Keep at most one `README.md` per folder.
- `README.md` files outside this folder should be short entry points that link here.
